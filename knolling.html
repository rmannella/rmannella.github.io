			<p>The task was to create a poster that represented the basics of poster design within a poster. It needed to be self explanatory. Some critique I have of my own work is based on the fact that the text says "poster design." This would be stronger if it was a call to action (such as "just start..."). One problem I found is that people are always scared to take the first step; they do not want to make fresh marks on a clean sheet of paper for fear they might fail. This poster tries to relieve that fear because the first marks are already there.</p>
