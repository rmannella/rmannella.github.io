    <div class="one-half column">
      <p>I am currently a senior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute studying Design, Innovation, & Society and Mechanical Engineering. This interdisciplinary dual-degree allows me to bring a unique perspective to the innovation industry because I have a foundation in both design practices and engineering techniques; I am at the crossroads between technicality and design with an added ability to think critically about technology and its impact on humanity and our environment.</p>
      <p>I am a quick and curious learner with expertise in many disciplines. I speak engineer. I speak design. I have project experience and have practice presenting and interacting with both users and consumers. In any field I pursue, I will be an asset because I bring an interdisciplinary set of technical and design skills. Beyond that I have thought analytically about these capabilities and have the confidence to thrive at the intersection between design, technicality, and social analysis.</p>
