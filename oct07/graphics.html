    <br><h3>Knolling</h3>
    <h6>Fall 2013</h6>
    <p>This project was completed in a group as part of the Studio III course. Our goal was to address the issue of being afraid to start something because it is a clean sheet of paper. We wanted to send the message to "just start."
    <br>Collaborators: Jeff Nasar, Evan Fouche, and David Rosenberg.</p>
