			<p class="graphic">The theme was "Infinite Possibilities," and I created a space-themed design. The top shirt reads "To infinity and beyond," and the two on the bottom are for the Navigating Rensselaer & Beyond (NRB) program. The shirts will be distributed to the incoming class of 2018, consisting of approximately 1500 students.</p>
